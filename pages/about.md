*Vancouver Modern: on the limits of portraiture* was made possible by recovering and scanning old photographic slides. Little remains of the pictures exhibited here except where an institution or collector holds a final print. 

For their help in the online exhibition process, I would like to thank Eka, Dave, and Robert.

To those who sat for me and participated in the creation of these works, thank you for your time and trust.
