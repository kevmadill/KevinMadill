This exhibition was made possible by recovering and scanning old photographic slides. Little remains of the pictures exhibited here except where an institution or collector holds a final print. 

For their help in the online exhibition process, I would like to thank Eka, Dave, and Robert.

To those who sat for me and participated in the creation of these works, thank you for your time and trust.


From there, you can run tests on your site to catch errors and decide where and how to put it online or in offline media.
