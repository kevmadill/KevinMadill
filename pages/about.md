*Vancouver Modern: on the limits of portraiture* was made possible by recovering and scanning old photographic slides. Little remains of the pictures exhibited here except where an institution or collector holds a final print. 

The author intends this to be the first of two online exhibitions. While *Vancouver Modern* focuses on works created between 1990 and 2000, *Vancouver Modern: part II* will pick up where the first left off at the end of the century. The hope is to complete the second by 2024.
