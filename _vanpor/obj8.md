### Sister and Brother (portriat of Maya and Adrian Saunders)

*Sister and Brother (portrait of Maya and Adrian Saunders)* makes use of a device previously employed in *Young Man at His Window (1991)* – an expanse of window frame functioning to differentiate public and private spheres and establish the foundational grid upon which the pictorial structure is built. Unlike so many ‘window pictures’[^1] by other artists, the window frame in my work is not used to open the eye to a vastness of space beyond. The goal here is something else, flatness. With *Sister and Brother*, the angled walls at the picture’s edges and the construction site in the distance focus the eye and curtail a limitless horizon.
