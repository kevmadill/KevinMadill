# Sister and Brother (portriat of Maya and Adrian Saunders)

Sister and Brother (portrait of Maya and Adrian Saunders) makes use of a device previously employed in Young Man at His Window – an expanse of window frame functioning to differentiate public and private spheres and establish the foundational grid upon which the pictorial structure is built. Unlike so many ‘window pictures’ by other artists, the window frame in my work is not used to open the eye to a vastness of space beyond. The goal here is something else, flatness. With Sister and Brother, the angled walls at the picture’s edges and the construction site in the distance focus the eye and curtail a limitless horizon.
