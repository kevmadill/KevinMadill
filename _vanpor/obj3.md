### Portrait of an Academic

*Portrait of an Academic* is a fantasy portrait inspired by the work of Otto Dix, in particular his fierce depictions of German society during the Weimar Republic. See Dix’s painting *Der Juwelier Karl Krall (1923)*, Von der Heydt-Museum Wuppertal, Germany; image under copyright. Dix actually made a living for a time through portraiture, even as painting was being supplanted by photography as the genre’s favoured medium. In *Portrait of an Academic*, the picture’s frame was constructed from fragments of the original transparency cut away in the process of creating the central tondo. The upper body has been sensitively distorted to mimic Parmigianino’s *Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror (1524)*. A blood red stain running down the far right wall scars the surface of the canvas, firmly constraining a stack of music scores that includes a copy of Hans Werner Henze’s setting of Jean Genet’s *Le Miracle de la Rose (1981)*.
