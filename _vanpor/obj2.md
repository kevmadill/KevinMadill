This picture was produced to accompany *August 1979 (1991)*. It’s a double back lit ciba. The figure was shot in silhouette against the architectural frame of a living room window during the summer of 1989, and then the composite finished photograph was exhibited in a light box. The image captures a strain marking the city’s homosexual business class before the turn of the century, caught between the possibilities consequent to a level of social progress and sexual freedom (i.e. the pink triangle pin on the young man’s lapel) and an economic order prioritizing wealth, consumption, and self-interest (note in the distance the labourer standing in silhouette and peering over the edge of the tower crane, the most visually prominent tool used in reshaping the city’s landscape). I was inspired by artists from a different time and place intent on capturing urban transformation and its consequent social impact: Edgar Degas’s silhouette portrait, *Woman at the Window (1872)*; Gustave Caillebotte’s masterpiece *Young Man at His Window (1875)*.
