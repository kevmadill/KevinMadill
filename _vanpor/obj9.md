### The Disaffected Hairdresser

*Disaffected Hairdresser* makes use of a visual device beautifully executed by Degas in his pastel *Ballet from an Opera Box (1884)*. Three spatial layers – foreground, middle-ground, and distance, are abutted one above each other on the flat plane of the canvas without any use of recession to achieve a compelling, dramatic effect. In a playful move, I replaced the hand of the spectator watching the stage which Degas had situated in the pastel’s foreground with the hairdresser’s foot and made more intricate middle-ground and far away through use of a mirror. Such spatial play will always and forever reference the complexities of modern urban life, something that has worked both to the advantage and disadvantage of the modern homosexual. 

Finally, a word on the content. Denman Street is one of the main traffic arteries running through Vancouver’s heavily populated West End. Businesses on the street come and go. City taxes make it impossible for most to survive. That doesn’t stop people from trying. I remember a man setting up a hairdressing salon on the strip back in the mid-90s. His shop never seemed terribly busy. Not a great sign for this neighbourhood. In his free time, the man would stand outside his shop talking to boyfriends. Sometimes his teenage son would show up looking pretty despondent. Occasionally, I would walk by and see the man’s tools of the trade sitting idle beside him on a clean white towel as he sat in the client’s chair reading a newspaper. It took about three years for the salon to finally disappear. We all have aspirations. So many of us want our independence, to be our own boss, do our own thing. We give it a go. Put everything we have into something we want to believe in. However, at what point do we check our aspirations at the door? Very few are lucky to get what they want in life. And then what do you do if you don’t? Blame the world and be miserable? Life is unfair. But also, way too short. To this day, I wonder what that hairdresser did with the rest of his life.
