<p><em>Sisters (portrait of Kristin and Marie Schopp)</em> is a personal response to the great German photographer August Sanders’s (1876-1964) unrealized and unrealizable project <em>Menschen des 20 Jahrhunderts (People of the 20th Century)</em>. With my image, the discourse between type and individual is localized to the level of the social subject’s primary collective experience, the family. It is in the family unit, after all, that so many of us begin the process of distinguishing ourselves from others and negotiating a connection to our past and what we aspire to be.</p>
