I"<p><em>Vancouver Modern: on the limits of portraiture</em> was made possible by recovering and scanning old photographic slides. Little remains of the pictures exhibited here except where an institution or collector holds a final print.</p>

<p>The author intends this to be the first of two online exhibitions. While <em>Vancouver Modern</em> focuses on works created between 1990 and 2000, <em>Vancouver Modern: part II</em> will pick up where the first left off at the end of the century. The hope is to complete the second by 2024.</p>
