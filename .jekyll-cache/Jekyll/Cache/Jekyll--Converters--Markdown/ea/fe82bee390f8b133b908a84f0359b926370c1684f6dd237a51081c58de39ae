<p>This picture was produced to accompany <em>August 1979 (1991)</em>. Itâ€™s a double back lit ciba. The figure was shot in silhouette against the architectural frame of a living room window during the summer of 1989, and then the composite finished photograph was exhibited in a light box. The image captures the strain of the cityâ€™s homosexual business class before the turn of the century, caught between the possibilities consequent to a level of social freedom (i.e. the pink triangle pin on the young manâ€™s lapel) and the desire for public success under an economic/political order completely devoid of moral comprehension (note in the distance the labourer standing in silhouette and peering over the edge of the tower crane, the most visually prominent tool used in reshaping the cityâ€™s landscape). I was inspired by artists from a different time and place intent on capturing urban transformation and its consequent social impact: Edgar Degasâ€™s silhouette portrait, <em>Woman at the Window (1872)</em>; Gustave Caillebotteâ€™s masterpiece <em>Young Man at His Window (1875)</em>.</p>
