<p><em>Sister and Brother (portrait of Maya and Adrian Saunders)</em> makes use of a device previously employed in <em>Young Man at His Window (1991)</em> â€“ an expanse of window frame functioning to differentiate public and private spheres and establish the foundational grid upon which the pictorial structure is built. Unlike other â€˜window picturesâ€™<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the window frame in my work is not used to open the eye to a vastness of space beyond. The goal here is something else, flatness. With <em>Sister and Brother</em>, the angled walls at the pictureâ€™s edges and the construction site in the distance focus the eye and curtail a limitless horizon.</p>
